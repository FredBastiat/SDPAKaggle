# SDPAKaggle
A repository for any and all code generated for the San Diego Predictive Analytics Meetup for the group Kaggle competition that anyone wants to share

Based on the survey results, we're going to be tackling the Titanic competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

We'll divide this repo into main sections:

    /data - contains all the raw data, and any munged/transformed datasets that anyone wants to share
    /python - a directory for any and all python code
    /r - a directory for any and all R code
    /XXXXX - <we can add as many different languages/tools as we want>
